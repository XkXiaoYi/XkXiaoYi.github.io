            TOR WAS PLACED CLOSE TO THE NEUTRON GENERATION. IT WAS22254001   30
            THEREFORE WELL SHIELDED. DURING THE ACTIVITY COUNTING 22254001   31
            PHASE THE NEUTRON GENERATION WAS STOPPED BY A PROTON  22254001   32

            ACTIVATED NICKEL CONTAINER, A LEAD SHIELDING OF 28 MM 22254001   34
            WAS PLACED BETWEEN THE SAMPLE AND THE DETECTOR. IN    22254001   35
            THIS WAY THE BACKGROUND COUNT RATE BETWEEN 200 KEV AND22254001   36
            6.1 MEV WAS REDUCED TO 10 KHZ FOR A SAMPLE-DETECTOR   22254001   37
            DISTANCE OF 50 MM. THIS COULD BE FURTHER REDUCED TO   22254001   38
